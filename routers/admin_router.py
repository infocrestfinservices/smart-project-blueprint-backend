"""The staff view of the product: who signed up, what they paid, what they generated.

None of this existed. Every question about the business — how many users, who is on a paid
plan, which orders never completed, whether an industry keeps failing to generate — had to be
answered by opening a Python shell against the database. That is fine once and useless as a
way to run something.

Every route here depends on `get_admin_user`, which 404s for everyone else, so the whole
prefix is invisible to a normal account. The only route that WRITES is the plan override,
because support work needs it (a payment that did not register, a refund, extending a trial);
it records who did it in the log, and it cannot grant admin — that is deliberate, and the
reason `is_admin` is only settable with grant_admin.py against the database.

Read paths are deliberately paginated and bounded: an admin page that tries to render every
row is the page that stops opening once the product works.

# ── roles ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# There are two roles: `admin` (this console) and `user` (everyone else), held on the user
# row as `is_admin`.
#
# This endpoint reverses an earlier decision. Admin was deliberately grantable ONLY by
# grant_admin.py against the database, on the reasoning that an endpoint which hands out
# admin is one authorisation bug away from anyone granting it to themselves. Putting it on
# the web was asked for, so the reasoning has to be answered rather than dropped — three
# locks do that:
#
#   1. only an admin can reach it at all (get_admin_user, which 404s for everyone else);
#   2. an admin cannot demote THEMSELVES, and the last admin cannot be demoted by anyone —
#      either would lock the whole team out of a console that can only be reopened by
#      someone with database access;
#   3. every change is logged with who did it, because a role change leaves no other trace.
#
# grant_admin.py stays, and is still the only way back in if the last admin is ever lost.
