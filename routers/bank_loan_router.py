bank_loan_router.py

HTTP surface for the Bank Loan report pipeline.

  POST /bank-loan/generate  -> Generic Pipeline -> (Bank Loan executor) -> .xlsx

The router validates the request and delegates to the Generic Pipeline. It no longer
knows anything about Bank Loan orchestration: it simply calls run_report_pipeline,
which resolves the PurposeConfig via the Purpose Catalog, selects the Bank Loan
executor, and delegates to the existing services/bank_loan_pipeline_service exactly as
before. No AI, template, Excel, orchestration or file-writing logic here.

# STAFF ONLY. This route ran the whole pipeline — AI call, workbook fill, LibreOffice
# recalculation, and a retry on a low DSCR, so up to two AI calls per request — with no
# login, no plan check and no rate limit. That was right when it was written: there were no
# accounts yet. It stopped being right the moment reports became something people pay for,
# because it is a second door to the product that walks straight past every plan limit on
# /generate/. On a public domain it is an open tab on the AI bill.
#
# Kept rather than deleted because it is how the engine is tested against a deployment. The
# admin dependency is what makes that safe: staff can still call it from the live URL, and
# for everyone else the address answers 404 — it does not even confirm the route exists.
