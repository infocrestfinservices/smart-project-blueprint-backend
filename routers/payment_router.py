"""Razorpay checkout for the three pricing plans.

The one rule everything here is built around: **the price is decided by the server**. The
browser says which plan it wants, never what it costs. If the amount came from the client,
anyone could open the console and buy the ₹4,999 plan for ₹1 — and the payment would verify
perfectly, because Razorpay only signs what it was asked to charge.

The flow is the standard three steps:
  1. POST /payments/order   — we create a Razorpay order for the plan's server-side price
                              and record it as "created"
  2. the browser opens Razorpay's checkout with that order
  3. POST /payments/verify  — Razorpay hands back an order_id, payment_id and signature; we
                              recompute the signature with our SECRET and only then mark the
                              payment paid and move the user onto the plan.

Step 3 is the whole security of it. A client that simply POSTs "I paid" gets rejected,
because it cannot produce a signature without the key secret, which never leaves this file's
side of the wire.
