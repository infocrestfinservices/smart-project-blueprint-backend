financing_reconciler.py

Makes the workbook's money tie to what the CLIENT actually said.

The AI fills the financing cells (term loan, promoter's capital) from the client's
stated figures, but it filled the COST-OF-PROJECT components (land, building, plant &
machinery, furniture) independently — so a project the client costed at ₹3 crore, and
financed with a ₹2.1 crore loan, showed only ₹40 lakh of assets being bought. Sources
did not equal uses, and the first question any CA or banker asks is "where did the rest
of the money go?".

This runs AFTER the AI fill and BEFORE the workbook is filled, and enforces
deterministically (never by asking the model again):

  1. Term loan and promoter's capital are the client's stated numbers, full stop.
  2. The cost-of-project components are scaled proportionally so they add up to the
     cost of project — which, in the CMA convention this workbook follows, is what the
     term loan plus promoter's capital funds. (Working capital is financed separately
     by the WC limit the model computes in Form V, so it is deliberately not part of
     this total.)
  3. If the AI gave no usable breakdown at all, a conventional split is applied so the
     total still ties instead of leaving the assets blank.

Only the CMA-family workbooks use these cells; a template without them is left alone.

    Nothing in the pipeline ever compared a PERIOD cost against revenue. `reconcile_scale`

    projects landed anywhere from 1.5% of revenue (a retail chain with no shop staff) to
    54%. The revenue streams made it worse: they add income but no incremental people, so
    every industry's EBITDA margin rose 1-6pp and labour's share fell.

    Both are fixed by measuring wages against TOTAL revenue — core plus streams — and
    clamping into the industry's own band. Running after reconcile_streams is what makes
    the stream half work: more revenue now means proportionally more staff.

    Clamps to the NEAREST EDGE of the band, not the middle, so a defensible figure the AI
    chose is nudged the minimum distance. Guarded so the correction can never push EBITDA
