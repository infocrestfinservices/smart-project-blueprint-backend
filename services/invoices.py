"""Issuing invoices, and the arithmetic behind them.

Two rules shape everything here.

**The charge is the fact; the split is arithmetic.** `gross` is what the customer was actually
billed, and the taxable value and tax are derived FROM it — never the other way round. Compute
the tax first and add it, and the invoice stops agreeing with the bank statement the moment a
coupon or a rounding rupee is involved.

**An invoice is issued once.** Razorpay retries webhooks and a customer can double-click a
confirm button, so every entry point asks for the invoice belonging to that payment before
creating one. A second invoice for the same money is not a duplicate row, it is a second
document with its own number that a customer may act on.
