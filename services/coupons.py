"""Discount codes, priced on the server.

The rule the whole module is built around is the same one the payment flow already follows:
**the browser says which code it wants to use, never what it is worth.** A discount computed
in the client and sent along would be signed by Razorpay exactly as faithfully as a real one —
their signature covers the amount they were asked to charge, not whether that amount was
correct. So every price here is derived from the coupon row and the plan's own price, and the
request contributes nothing but a string.

Two rules that are easy to get wrong and expensive to get wrong:

**A coupon is consumed at VERIFICATION, not at checkout.** Opening a checkout and closing it
must not use up a limited code, or a few curious visitors exhaust a code nobody redeemed.

**Limits are re-checked at redemption.** Between previewing a code and paying with it, the
last use can be taken by someone else. Checking only at preview is how a "first 50 customers"
coupon ends up redeemed 60 times.
