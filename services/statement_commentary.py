statement_commentary.py

Writes the explanation that sits under each statement in the Word report — what the
statement is, what the numbers actually do across the five years, and why that matters
to a lender or grant assessor.

The commentary is COMPUTED FROM THE TABLE'S OWN NUMBERS rather than written by the
model, so it can never describe a trend the table does not show. Each note is roughly
ten lines: two or three explaining what the statement is and how it is read, then
observations drawn from the actual figures (direction, magnitude, turning points,
benchmark breaches).
