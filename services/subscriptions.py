"""Auto-pay: recurring billing through Razorpay Subscriptions.

The one-time Orders flow charges once and stops. That is right for Starter, which is sold as
a one-time purchase, and wrong for Professional and Enterprise, which are sold per month and
were being charged once and granted for ever. Subscriptions is Razorpay taking the mandate
from the customer and debiting it each cycle; we hear about each debit on a webhook and move
the plan's expiry to whatever date THEY say the customer is now paid up to.

Three things drive the design.

**Razorpay owns the dates.** Every cycle boundary comes from `current_end` on the event, not
from adding 30 days here. A retried charge, a customer on a different timezone, a cycle
Razorpay shifted — all of those make a locally-computed date wrong, and a wrong expiry either
locks out a paying customer or gives away a month.

**Webhooks arrive more than once.** Razorpay retries until it gets a 2xx, so the same
`subscription.charged` will be delivered again after any blip. Each event id is recorded and
a repeat is ignored, because processing one twice extends a paid-up period nobody paid for.

**Webhooks arrive out of order.** `subscription.activated` can land after the first
`subscription.charged`. Nothing here assumes a sequence: each handler sets the state it knows
about, and the expiry only ever moves FORWARD.
