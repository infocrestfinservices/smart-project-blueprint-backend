    - Complex generation (the report narrative) is a large JSON that makes v4-flash burn

      which surfaced to the user as a 502 on every regeneration. Those callers pass

      different provider entirely.
    - As a safety net, ANY empty answer from the cheap model is retried once on the heavy
      one, so a borderline prompt can never again leave the whole report failed.
