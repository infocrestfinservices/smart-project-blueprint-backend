"""
template_model_service.py

Generates the user's OWN financial model as a set of input-cell values for a
chosen sample template. The sample is a DESIGN BLUEPRINT only — we never keep its
business numbers. The AI reads all the chatbot/questionnaire answers, computes
realistic assumptions for THIS business, and returns one value per input cell.
Those values are written into the template's input cells; the template's own
formulas then recompute every dependent sheet, chart, KPI and ratio.

So the division of labour is:
  - AI  -> the input assumptions/drivers for the user's business
  - the sample's formulas -> every derived statement (P&L, cash flow, IRR, …)

This keeps the model mathematically consistent (the template guarantees it) while
guaranteeing the output represents the user's business, not the sample's.

    return f"""You are a senior Chartered Accountant and financial modeller building the input assumptions for a client's project financial model.

CLIENT BUSINESS (use ALL of this):
{_project_summary(project)}

SUPPORTING ANALYSIS (context; do not contradict):
{(agent_context or '')[:2500]}

Below is the list of INPUT cells of a professional financial-model template. Each line shows a stable key, a human label, the expected unit, and a sample_example value from an UNRELATED sample business. The sample_example shows ONLY the format/scale/units — it is from a different business and you must NEVER reuse it.

Produce a realistic, internally-consistent value for EVERY key, computed for the CLIENT'S business described above. Base values on the client's stated numbers where given (cost, capacity, prices, financing, tax, growth, etc.), and estimate sensible industry-appropriate figures for anything not stated. Use the "basis" note on each cell to keep values in a realistic band. Monetary values are in {currency}. Percentages MUST be decimal fractions (0.15, not 15). Years/counts are plain integers. "short free text" cells take a brief string (e.g. the unit's name or plant location).

MODEL VIABILITY — THIS IS CRITICAL. The output MUST be a VIABLE, BANKABLE business, not a loss-making one. Before returning, mentally check the arithmetic the template will do:
  * ANNUAL REVENUE = volume (capacity/transactions/units) × selling price. Size the VOLUME and PRICE so revenue is large enough to cover ALL costs and leave a profit.
  * TOTAL ANNUAL COSTS = per-unit variable costs × volume  +  12 × each monthly fixed cost (wages, overheads, admin, rent, etc.)  +  depreciation  +  interest. The SUM of these MUST be COMFORTABLY LESS than revenue.
  * The business must show a POSITIVE EBITDA and a healthy EBITDA margin (typically 10–30% of revenue for the industry) from YEAR 1, and positive profit after tax by Year 1 or Year 2 at the latest.
  * It must service its debt: yearly (profit after tax + depreciation + interest) must be at least 1.5× the yearly loan repayment (DSCR ≥ 1.5).
  * Monthly fixed costs are PER MONTH — do not set them so high that 12× them exceeds a large share of revenue. A tiny business with huge salaries is not viable; scale fixed costs to the revenue.
If your first pass would make a loss, INCREASE the volume/price or REDUCE the costs until the business is clearly profitable and bankable. Never return a model where costs exceed revenue.

TARGET MARKET SEGMENTS — if the field list contains "Segment N — Segment name" / "Segment N — Share of revenue" cells, split the revenue across the CLIENT'S OWN stated target market and customers (quoted above). Name each segment in the client's words, not generic ones (e.g. for a dermatology clinic: "Walk-in OPD patients", "Referral patients", "Insurance / corporate tie-ups"; for a shop: "Walk-in retail", "Bulk / institutional", "Online orders"). Use as many of the five rows as the business genuinely has and leave the rest blank. The shares MUST be decimal fractions that ADD UP TO EXACTLY 1.0 across the segments you fill, and the biggest segment should reflect where the client said most of their business comes from.
{("MODEL CONSISTENCY REQUIREMENTS (obey exactly): " + constraints) if constraints else ""}

INPUT CELLS:
{chr(10).join(field_lines)}

Return ONLY a single JSON object mapping each key to its value, nothing else:
{{ "Sheet!Cell": <number or short string>, ... }}
Rules:
- Include every key listed above.
- Numeric cells are plain numbers (no currency symbols, commas or text); free-text cells are short strings.
- Never output the sample_example values; compute for the client's business.
- Keep the model consistent AND profitable: financing = equity + loan ≈ project cost; revenue exceeds total costs every year; positive EBITDA and DSCR ≥ 1.5; a volume ramp that starts lower and rises."""
