"""What each plan actually buys — and the one place that decides it.

Until now the payment flow WROTE `user.plan` and nothing anywhere READ it. A grep across
the backend and the frontend found no check of any kind, so a ₹4,999 Enterprise payment and
a free signup got byte-for-byte the same product. Two things made that worse: the `plan`
column defaulted to `"starter"`, which is the name of the ₹499 plan, so every one of the 16
users in the database was already sitting on a paid plan they had never bought; and the two
monthly plans were charged as one-time orders with no expiry, so ₹1,499 once bought the plan
for ever.

This module is the single source of truth for all three: the price, what the plan allows,
and when it runs out. `payment_router` charges from here, `generation_router` gates from
here. Adding a plan or changing a limit is editing PLANS — nothing else.

The limits come from the public pricing page, so what is charged and what is delivered
cannot drift apart:

  free            a trial — 1 report, PDF only
  starter    ₹499 one-time — 3 reports, PDF only
  professional ₹1,499 / month — unlimited reports, PDF + Word + Excel
  enterprise ₹4,999 / month — the same, plus what is sold on top of it (seats,
                              white-label) which is not modelled here yet

`free` is not on the pricing page; a product nobody can try does not get bought, so one
report is allowed without paying. It is a deliberate addition, not something read off the
page.
