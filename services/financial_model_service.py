financial_model_service.py

Builds a purpose-specific prompt that instructs the LLM to act as a Chartered
Accountant and return a STRICT JSON financial model (no narrative prose outside
the JSON). The backend then turns that JSON into Word + Excel.

This does NOT add a new agent — it composes the existing agents' output
(market / feasibility / swot) plus the questionnaire answers into one
structured-output call.

default section list and the default emphasis. If they ask for content that does not fit
any required section, ADD a new narrative section for it (see the narrative rules below).

be shown from the figures, say so plainly in the report instead of inventing it.

- Recompute every figure from the user's inputs, consistent with the sample's methodology.
- Where the user hasn't supplied a value, infer a realistic one consistent with their business and note it as an assumption.

Produce a complete, internally-consistent model. All monetary values are PLAIN NUMBERS in {currency} (no commas, no symbols, no text). Use realistic CA-grade figures derived from the inputs. Projections cover the standard horizon for this purpose (typically 5 years; for CMA use 2 past + 3 projected).

  "kpis": [ {{ "label": "e.g. IRR / DSCR / Break-even", "value": "e.g. 18.4% / 1.85 / 62%" }} ]
}}

The "narrative" object MUST contain AT LEAST these keys:
{chr(10).join(section_specs)}

You MAY add further narrative keys beyond this list, but ONLY to satisfy the client's own
requirements above. Give any such section a short, self-explanatory title (e.g. "Monthly
Revenue Break-up"); it will be rendered after the standard sections. Add nothing extra if
the client asked for nothing extra.

Rules:{f'''
- The client's own requirements at the top of this prompt take priority over the default
  structure and emphasis. Re-read them before you write the narrative, and make the change
  they asked for visible in the output — do not return the same report you would have
  written without them.''' if ask else ''}
- Write PROSE only. Do NOT reproduce the financial statements: every table, schedule and
  CMA form is generated from the workbook itself, so a table written here is paid for twice
  and can only disagree with the model. Quote a figure in a sentence where it makes the
  point, and nothing more.
- Numbers you quote are the ones given above. Do not invent others.
- Output must be valid JSON and nothing else."""
