operating_models.py

The OPERATING MODEL of each industry — what actually drives its revenue and cost,
in that industry's own vocabulary. This is the heart of industry adaptability: a
manufacturer runs on capacity × utilisation and per-unit conversion cost; a shop
runs on transactions × average bill and cost of goods; a hotel on room-nights ×
tariff; a SaaS firm on subscribers × ARPU. The arithmetic shape for every
service/trade business is the same — VOLUME × PRICE for revenue, and COST OF SALES
as a margin off revenue — so one engine computes them all; only the DRIVERS
(their names, units and benchmark bands) change per industry. Manufacturing keeps
its own capacity-based model (the frozen Bank Loan path).

Each model is pure data. Adding an industry is adding a spec here (plus, for the
workbook, an industry template) — never new calculation code. The generic
volume-price-margin engine in service_calc.py reads these specs.

Fields
------
key            : industry slug (matches the Industry enum value / folded name)
display_name   : human name (matches INDUSTRY_MAP key where one exists)
family         : "capacity" (manufacturing-style) or "volume_price" (service/trade)
volume_label   : what one unit of activity is ("Transactions / customers", "Covers
                 served", "Room-nights sold", "Active subscribers", "Patients treated")
price_label    : what the per-unit price means ("Average bill value", "Average order
                 value", "Average room tariff", "ARPU / month", "Average treatment charge")
cost_label     : the main cost of sales line ("Cost of goods sold", "Food & beverage
                 cost", "Cost of services")
margin_hint    : (low, high) typical gross-margin band for sanity checks / defaults
operational_kpis : the industry-specific KPIs a CA/analyst expects on the dashboard
stream_mix     : the four ANCILLARY revenue streams the industry template exposes
                 (Assumptions C66:C69), each as a fraction of CORE revenue
                 (volume x price). A hotel earns F&B and banquet income on top of
                 room revenue; a shop earns very little beyond the till. Used to seed
                 those cells when the AI leaves them blank, so no report ever ships
                 with an empty "Additional revenue streams" block.
default_segments : fallback target-market segments (name, share) summing to 1.0, used
                 only when the AI named none — so the segment table is never blank and
                 always ties to Net Sales.

    Three passes, and the last one is why this function stopped returning None:

    1. exact match on the folded name — "Food & Beverage / Restaurant" -> restaurant;
    2. CONTAINS a known alias, longest first — real projects arrive as "Hospitality &
       Tourism" (the alias is "tourismhospitality", the other word order) or as "AI SaaS
       (Artificial Intelligence...), Business Software, Fintech", a whole sentence;
    3. otherwise the GENERAL model.

    Returning None was a silent trap. An unmapped industry had no `stream_mix`, so
    `reconcile_streams` had nothing to fill with and the revenue streams stayed at zero; it
    had no `key`, so the template lookup fell through to `bank_loan_cma` and a consulting
    firm was modelled as a factory with installed capacity. Seven stored projects were in
    that state — Consulting, Legal Services, Service, AI SaaS, Hospitality & Tourism. The
    `other` model exists exactly for this and was simply never reached.
