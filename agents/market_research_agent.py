Analyse the following business and produce a market research report a lending banker

SCOPE — this is the most important instruction:
Write about **{where} and its surrounding region**, not about the national market. The
demand, the pricing, the distribution channels and above all the COMPETITORS must be the
ones this business will actually meet in {where}. Name real local and regional players
and formats where you can; where a national brand matters, say how strongly it is present
in {where} specifically. Give national figures only as background, clearly labelled, and
never in place of the local picture.

IMPORTANT: The report already opens with an Executive Summary and a company introduction.
Do NOT write another executive summary, company introduction or overall conclusion here —
those belong to the report, not to this section. Begin directly with the market itself and
END after the risks. Do not add a "Conclusion" or "Recommendations" section.

Generate the following sections in Markdown format:

## 1. Market Overview
- Size of the {where} / regional market (TAM, SAM, SOM)
- Growth rate and CAGR, with the local driver behind it
## 2. Target Customers
- Who they are in {where} — demographics, buying behaviour, price sensitivity
- Customer segments and the channel each is reached through
## 3. Industry Trends
- What is changing in {where} and the region
- Outlook over the projection period
## 4. Competitor Analysis
| Competitor | Presence in {where} | Strengths | Weaknesses | Estimated Share |
List the players this business will genuinely compete with in {where} — local
manufacturers, regional brands and the national names that are actually stocked there.
## 5. Market Opportunities
## 6. Market Risks

Use markdown tables where they help. Keep every figure specific to {scope}.
