    This agent runs BEFORE the financial model exists, so the only money it is given is the
    cost of the project and how it is funded. Left to itself it invented the rest — a sales
    figure, an expense figure — and then argued with its own invention inside the finished
    document: "The projected expenses of ₹18 lakh appear to be either…", "net surplus is
    only ~₹3 lakh, which is not sufficient". A bank submission cannot contain a section
    disputing the report's own numbers, and those numbers were never the report's to begin
    with. So it is told plainly: assess the business, do not compute the projections.

THE MOST IMPORTANT INSTRUCTION — read it before you write anything:
The financial projections for this project are produced separately by a structured
financial model, and they appear elsewhere in this same report. You have NOT been shown
them. Therefore:
- Do NOT invent, estimate or state any sales, revenue, expense, profit, margin, unit
  volume, price or break-even figure. Not even approximately, not even "roughly".
- Do NOT perform arithmetic and do NOT check whether figures "add up" — you do not have the
  figures, and a section that questions the report's own numbers destroys its credibility
  with the lender.
- The ONLY monetary amounts you may mention are the three given above.
- Judge financial feasibility on STRUCTURE — the promoter's stake against the borrowing,
  the scale of the project for this industry, what the money is being spent on, and what
  would have to hold true for it to work. Say what to watch, not what the numbers are.
