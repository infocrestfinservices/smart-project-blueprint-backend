    """A document the customer keeps.

    Almost every field here is a SNAPSHOT, and that is the point. An invoice records what was
    true on the day it was issued: if the customer later changes their name, or the company
    moves office or registers for GST, the document they already hold must not change with
    them. Reading these from `users` or from config at render time would quietly rewrite
    history every time something was edited — which is exactly what an invoice exists to
    prevent.

    Linked to a Payment or a Subscription, never both. One-time purchases come from a
    payment; a renewal comes from the `subscription.charged` webhook.
